BMW Regional Strategy & Market Intelligence Team

Business Problem

“We have BMW sales data from 2010 to 2024, but we don’t have a single analytics view to understand:

which regions are growing/declining,

which models & fuel types are winning,

what’s happening with pricing, mileage, engine size,

and how sales performance changes year-by-year.”

Acceptance Criteria (How client will approve)

Dashboard must load with full dataset and allow filtering without breaking visuals

KPIs must match filtered data correctly

YoY growth should not show wrong values (handle first year as “N/A”)

Revenue must be calculated consistently: Price_USD * Sales_Volume

Final output should be presentable for leadership
